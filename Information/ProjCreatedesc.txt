FastAPI Redis Caching is a lightweight, decorator based middleware designed to make high-performance API development effortless. By wrapping standard FastAPI routes with a simple @cache() decorator, developers can reduce database load and slash response times from hundreds of milliseconds to near-instant. It features automatic key generation, graceful failover (so your app doesn't crash if Redis goes down), and namespace support for clean cache management
